<H1>Congratulations!</H1>
<H2>You found the Bonus Page!</H2>
<P>I mean, <A HREF="https://github.com/ttbtech/thetechboy/blob/main/index.html" TARGET="_blank">unless you looked at the source code of the main site to find the JS that leads you here.</A> But we all know that you aren't like that.. right? Who am I kidding, I have absolutely no idea as to who you are.</P>
<P>I know, it's quite an underwhelming page. I don't know why I made this. Neither do I know why you are here in the first place. Uh, make yourself at home, I guess???</P>
<P>Don't ask why this page has absolutely no CSS and why I'm using an incredibly outdated way to change the background color (and why I'm avoiding HTML best practices). It's all part of this page's non-existent flair.</P>
